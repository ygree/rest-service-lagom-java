  # partition are created in surviving partition. The purpose of this margin is that
  # in case of a network partition the persistent actors in the non-surviving partitions
  # must be stopped before corresponding persistent actors are started somewhere else.
  # This is useful if you implement downing strategies that handle network partitions,
  # e.g. by keeping the larger side of the partition and shutting down the smaller side.
  # Decision is taken by the strategy when there has been no membership or
  # reachability changes for this duration, i.e. the cluster state is stable.
